        text: "Rule 1.1 of the American Bar Association (ABA) Model Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC), states “A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.”\_ In comment 8 of this rule, the ABA clarifies that a lawyer has a duty to keep abreast of the “benefits and risks associated with relevant technology.”"

        text: "The ABA MRPC, in Rule 1.6, outlines a lawyer’s responsibility regarding the confidentiality of a client’s information. It says that a lawyer cannot divulge a client’s data “unless the client gives informed consent, the disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation, or the disclosure is permitted” in an enumerated list of circumstances.\_ Rule 1.6 also says “A lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to prevent the inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, information relating to the representation of a client.”"

        text: "The reasoning for such rule is common sense – a client needs to be able to trust the lawyer with sensitive information in order for the client to receive the best representation.\_ A client will more readily be candid with the lawyer if the client knows that their secrets will be kept.\_ \_Data privacy and security also has more practical effects, such as curtailing identity theft."

        text: "The rule not only applies to the lawyer divulging client information herself, but it also prohibits lawyer conduct that could lead to the discovery of the sensitive information by a third party.\_ The MRPC comment to Rule 1.6 states that the rule of confidentiality is not violated when there is unauthorized access to a client’s information if the lawyer “has made reasonable efforts to prevent the access or disclosure.” \_For a further discussion on “reasonable efforts”, keep reading."

So, when analyzing a particular federal privacy law, also take note of who must comply with the law."

For example, one such right is the “Right to Delete” and it dictates that a client has the right to request that you delete all personal information about them that you have collected.\_"

        text: "Most attorneys don’t store paper files anymore; gone are the days of huge boxes filled with paper, jamming up closets and storage facilities.\_ Instead, as more offices are going green and striving for efficiency when storing data, client files are kept in electronic format and stored with a third-party vendor.\_ The “cloud” refers to storage services that are internet based.\_ Meaning, it is not storage available locally on the attorney’s computer or network but instead is located on a remote server.\_ Most commonly, this remote server is hosted by a third party, such as Practice Panther, Dropbox, Clio, or Salesforce.\_ In addition to storing data with a third-party vendor, client data can be shared with third-party vendors for various other purposes including billing, computer maintenance, or document drafting."
