        text: 'The ElderCounsel website (www.eldercounsel.com), drafting software (ElderDocx®, EC TransferCalc™, and products we may develop in the future), Law as a Business, and other related services, including the online ElderCounsel store (collectively, “ElderCounsel Services” or “Services”) are provided by ElderCounsel, LLC and its related companies and affiliates (“ElderCounsel,” “us,” or “we”). ElderCounsel is a membership-based organization featuring a collaborative network of thousands of practitioners throughout all fifty states. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and disclosed by ElderCounsel, and applies to information we collect when you use or access ElderCounsel Services or when you otherwise interact with us. We respect the privacy rights of users and recognize the importance of protecting information collected about you. If you use the Services as part of an entity or organization that has an agreement with ElderCounsel (like your employer), or if you enter into an agreement directly with ElderCounsel, the terms of that agreement will control any inconsistency between such an agreement and this Privacy Policy.'
